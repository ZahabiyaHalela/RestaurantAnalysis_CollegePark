# RestaurantAnalysis_CollegePark

The idea of this Semester 1 Database class project was to create a database to collect the rating and location information for restaurants that are currently open in College Park from various sources and give valuable feedback to those businesses who want to open a new restaurant in the area. We also aimed to use the data collected to provide recommendations to existing businesses by comparing reviews across sites and helping them increase revenue.

### Business Implication : 
More often than not restaurant businesses need help with brainstorming what city/location to launch in next. The decision is a product of multiple factors - competition, demographics, etc. Our idea is to effectively use this database and address this very question; We aim to utilize the information and consult owners who want to open a new restaurant in the College Park area. We will use the data collected and give guidance on what parameters affect restaurant reviews in the city based on granular location details

I persoanlly really enjoyed working on this project since we as a team were able to experince and work with all the aspects of the data analytics lifecycle, all the way from data collection, data cleaning, database creation and finally querying the data to get appropriate results.
