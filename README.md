# RestaurantAnalysis_CollegePark

The idea of this Semester 1 project was to create a database to collect the rating and location information for restaurants that are already open in College Park from various sources and give valuable feedback to those businesses who want to open a new restaurant in the area. We also would use the data to provide recommendations to existing businesses by comparing reviews across sites and helping them increase revenue.

More often than not restaurant businesses need help with brainstorming what city/location to launch in next. The decision is a product of multiple factors - competition, demographics, etc. Our idea is to effectively use this database and address this very question; We aim to utilize the information and consult owners who want to open a new restaurant in the College Park area. We will use the data collected and give guidance on what parameters affect restaurant reviews in the city based on granular location details.
